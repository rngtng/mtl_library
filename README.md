# Metal Library - mtl_library

Collection of various mtl (Metal) libs. My attempt to streamline most of the \*.mtl
files in order to join forces :)

## Projects

## Compilation

In order to compile the code, make use of https://github.com/rngtng/mtl_linux / https://github.com/RedoXyde/mtl_linux

### Mac OSX / macOS

Simplest way on macOS is using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Find the latest formular here: https://github.com/rngtng/homebrew-mtl_linux with

```
brew tap rngtng/homebrew-mtl_linux
brew install mtl_linux
```

## Test

Once compiler & simulator installed, run the test

```
make test
```

## Documentation

See *\_docs* for a collection of language grammar and command description. See to:

## Understanding the Bytecode

The bytecode is written in a custom language by Sylvain Huet. It is referenced as _Metal_ and files end with `.mtl`. Unfortunately documentation is very poor (and in french). Check directory `bytecode/_original` which contains a basic overview & documentation as well as a list of (common) commands. A good reference is the original bytecode, included in the directory as well. Major parts got extracted into seperate files, found in `bytecode/lib/` directory and ready to be included in your code.

Grammar: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMg2wSyMKTmsilCpOByi_59uk5dD8XMfGAu20W63kZE/edit?hl=en_US

### Testing

The kit includes a simple test framework to test custom bytecode. See `bytecode/test/test.mtl`. A typical test looks like this:

```c
 let test "math operations" -> t in
  (
    //assertions
    assert_equalI 0 10 - (2 * 5);
  0);
```

The framework offers assertions similar to [Ruby Test::Unit](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/Test/Unit.html) style. Mind that the variable type has to be given
explicit. Convention is:

  * I = integer
  * S = string
  * L = list
  * T = table

Following assertions are available (see bytecode/test/helper.mtl)

  * assert_equalI I I
  * assert_equalI S S
  * assert_nil I
  * assert_equalIL
  * assert_equalSL
  * assert_equalTL
